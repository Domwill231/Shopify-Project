# Zuber Project.
This project illustrates the power of data analysis in driving strategic decision-making 
and optimizing operations within the taxi and ride-sharing industry. Our findings highlight
the significance of identifying high-demand areas, understanding the competitive landscape,
and considering external influences like weather conditions. By recognizing key passenger 
destinations such as The Loop, River North, and Streeterville, companies can tailor their 
services to enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, insights into the competitive 
positioning of companies like Flash Cab and the impact of weather on trip durations provide
valuable guidance for refining operational strategies. Ultimately, leveraging these insights
allows businesses to improve service efficiency and maintain a competitive advantage in a rapidly
evolving market.
